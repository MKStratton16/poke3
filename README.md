Welcome!\rYou may exchange your Coins for\nfabulous prizes here!\r
Which prize would you like?
So your choice is\nthe \v0108\x0000\x0000?
So your choice is \v0108\x0000\x0000:\n\v0106\x0001\x0000?
Here you go!
You don't have enough Coins.\r
There isn't any room available for\nthat \v0108\x0000\x0000.\r
Oh, is that so? \nPlease come back with some Coins!
I woke up and realized my potential!\rSo, what potential was woken in me?\nWhat's my hidden power, you ask?\rIt's a power that lets me see the\nHidden Power of a Pokémon.\rWhen they learn that move, I can tell\nwhat type the move will be.\rSo, want me to use my hidden power?\rI'll tell you what type your Pokémon's\nHidden Power will be.
I'll tell you what type your Pokémon's\nHidden Power will be.\rMy own hidden power lets me do that.
If this Pokémon were to learn\nHidden Power, the move's type\fwould be \v010f\x0000\x0000.
This Pokémon's Hidden Power is the\n\v010f\x0000\x0000 type.
If you want to know, ask me, and I'll\nactivate my hidden power for you.
A move that an Egg can learn?!\nThat's flat-out impossible.
Oh, no. This Pokémon can't learn the\nmove Hidden Power in the first place.
They have prizes I really want.\nBut Coins, I have none!
